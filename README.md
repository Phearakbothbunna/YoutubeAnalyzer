# YoutubeAnalyzer
Team members: Phearak Both Bunna, Jack Balster, Ryan Biggs, Nico Williams

+ Our team has decided to use Jupyter notebook for our YoutubeAnalyzer project and we can easily run the appliation/UI:
  - Scroll to the last cell and run it (it's in the GUI/Visualization section)
+ The dataset that we used for the project was saved in "data" folder but the instruction says not to submit any dataset
  - We downloaded the data from https://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/
  - Only 3 crawls were used and here's the name of each crawl dataset folder: 080327, 080329, 080331
